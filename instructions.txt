- There should be 1 invoice for each account. For example, there there are 7 accounts in the example object. Thus, 7 invoices. 
- Each invoice should have 2 tabs, invoice and returns_and_other


- returns_and_other 
    - has 3 columns
        1. Batch Number
        2. Description
        3. Amount - Formatted as Currency/Accounting 
    - These columns should be empty, and will be manually filled at a later date.
    - Named Ranges should be created out of Batch Number and Amount. They will be used in a sumifs formula later.

- invoice
    - Each invoice should include all batch numbers for that account. Each batch number goes on its own row.
    - Columns A-E, as well as the file name will come from the input data structure.
    - The information resulting in column F won't be available until after the invoice is generated. It will be manually entered on the returns_and_other tab
    - Column G should be a sum of columns D, E, F 
    - H is column G * 1.03 
    - Column I is todays date. This date should NOT change if the invoice is opened on a future date however.
    - Column J is the date in column I + 7. This should be a formula. 
    - Columns K and L come from the input data structure.
